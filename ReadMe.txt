This is Jose and Jesus and Alejandra were my partners
I designed the game which is 5-draw poker and they build the menus, I think we all did pretty well. I took on the harder portion mainly because I had more experience with
coding, but they still did pretty well both with the design and implementation
Instructions:
Click Draw and review your 5 cards
Bet any amount and see what the computer decides
If they fold, the game ends
If they raise, you now decide to match(click continue) or fold(click fold)
If the computer matches you move on
You can now discard, click the cards to do so and click continue when you are ready to replace the selected cards
You can unselect the cards by the way
After this you are given new cards to replace the selected ones if they exist
With your new cards(or old ones) you now place another bet, and once again see what the computer decides
If they fold, the game ends
If they raise, you now decide to match(click continue) or fold(click fold)
If the computer matches you move on
After this, you can now click Continue to see the winner and money is given to them

At the end of any game you can see the terminal to see what the computer had
if there are any bugs go ahead and report them to me(jose) as I am going to add more to this
